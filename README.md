# SeleniumCucumberFrameworkDesign
This is a Java-based automation framework designed to test the functionality of the practice GreenKart e-commerce website. The goal of this framework is to build a scalable and easy-to-maintain solution from scratch. To achieve this, the framework is based on the Page Object Model, which helps in creating a more robust and maintainable test suite. The framework is supported by Cucumber BDD, which helps to create readable and easily understandable test scenarios. With JUnit as an execution tool, it is easy to add useful plugins such as Extent Reporter without lots of code.

An error in the step "Then Validate that product names in TopDeals page and Landing page are equals" is intentional, it needs to demonstrate screenshot functionality.
